Hi Support Team,

I'm experiencing a critical issue with the application crashing during peak hours. This is affecting our business operations.

Details:
- Application Version: 2.1.0
- Account Number: ACC123456
- Error Message: "NullPointerException in ProcessManager.java:120"
- Frequency: Every 2-3 hours during high load

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Process multiple transactions simultaneously
2. Monitor server memory usage
3. Application crashes after memory spikes

Please investigate and provide a fix as soon as possible.

Best regards,
John Doe
