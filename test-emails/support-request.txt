Hello Support Team,

I need assistance with configuring custom reports in the system.

Issue:
I'm trying to create a custom report with specific filters and grouping, but I'm having trouble with the following:
- Setting up date range filters
- Configuring group-by clauses
- Adding calculated columns

Current Setup:
- Using web interface
- Chrome browser
- System version 2.5.0

Account Number: ACC345678

What I've Tried:
1. Followed documentation steps
2. Checked FAQ section
3. Tried different browsers

Can you please provide step-by-step guidance?
